## Progress

### [2025-06-02] Initial Analysis

- TS1206 means decorators are used in an invalid context (e.g., not on a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter).
- Most likely cause: misplaced decorators, or code structure/formatting issues (e.g., stray decorators, copy-paste errors, or misplaced code blocks).
- Will proceed file by file, starting with `admin.controller.ts`.

### [2025-06-02] backend/src/modules/admin/admin.controller.ts

- Status: **No TS1206 errors currently detected**
- Notes: Checked with the latest error scan. Errors may have been fixed in a previous commit, or the error log is outdated compared to the current codebase.

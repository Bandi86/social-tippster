# Change Log - CommentList Import Issue Resolution

**Date:** June 1, 2025, 10:15 AM
**Type:** Bug Fix & Environment Resolution
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Issue Summary

Investigation and resolution of reported CommentList component import error in PostDetailPage, which turned out to be a development environment port conflict issue rather than an actual import problem.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Component Import Status

- **CommentList Import**: `import CommentList from '@/components/features/comments/CommentList';` - **WORKING**
- **Component Usage**: `<CommentList postId={post.id} className="..." />` at line 483 - **WORKING**
- **Component Structure**: All comment components properly organized and exported

### 🔍 Root Cause Identified

The actual issue was **port conflicts** in the development environment:

- Multiple Node.js processes were running on ports 3000 and 3001
- Backend server failed to start due to `EADDRINUSE` error
- Frontend was sometimes using incorrect ports

## Actions Taken

### 🧹 Environment Cleanup

1. **Process Termination**:

   ```bash
   pkill -f concurrently
   pkill -f next-server
   pkill -f nest
   ```

2. **Port Verification**:

   ```bash
   ss -tlnp | grep :300
   ```

3. **Clean Restart**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/bandi/Documents/social-tippster && npm run dev
   ```

### ✅ Component Architecture Verified

- **CommentList.tsx**: Main comments container with proper `export default`
- **CommentCard.tsx**: Individual comment display component
- **CommentForm.tsx**: Comment creation/editing form
- **index.ts**: Barrel export file for clean imports
- **Directory**: `/frontend/components/features/comments/` - properly organized

## Current Server Status

### 🚀 Development Servers Running

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅

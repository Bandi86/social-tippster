### Application Status

- **Backend**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000 ‚úÖ
- **Database**: Connected and synchronized ‚úÖ
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:3001/api/docs ‚úÖ

### Database Connection Details

- Host: localhost
- Port: 5432
- User: postgres
- Database: tippmix
- Status: Connected and operational

### Migration Resolution Method

The migration issue was resolved through TypeORM's automatic synchronization during application startup. The system detected existing tables and properly synchronized the database schema without conflicts.

## üîç VERIFICATION COMPLETED

## üéØ SUMMARY

**Problem Solved**: The database migration synchronization issue has been fully resolved. The application is now running normally with all services operational.

**Method Used**: TypeORM's built-in synchronization capabilities automatically resolved the schema conflicts during startup, eliminating the need for manual migration fixes.

**Current State**:

- Application fully functional ‚úÖ
- Database properly synchronized ‚úÖ
- All services running smoothly ‚úÖ
- Ready for normal development/testing ‚úÖ

**Files Created During Process**:

- `migration-setup.sql` (backup solution)
- `fix-migration.sh` (alternative approach)

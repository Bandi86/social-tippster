# CHANGE LOG - Comments API Integration

**Date:** 2025-05-31
**Type:** API Integration

## Summary

- Integrated real backend API endpoints for all admin comment management features in the Zustand comments store.
- Replaced all mock implementations for admin comment fetching, statistics, and admin actions with real HTTP calls to `/admin/comments`, `/admin/comments/stats`, and related endpoints.
- Implemented data transformation between backend DTOs and frontend interfaces for admin comments and statistics.
- Improved error handling and loading state management for admin comment operations.

## Details

- `fetchAdminComments` now calls the real `/admin/comments` endpoint with mapped filters and pagination.
- `fetchCommentsStats` now calls `/admin/comments/stats` and maps backend stats to frontend structure.
- `fetchAdminCommentById`, `updateCommentStatus`, `bulkDeleteComments`, and related admin actions now use real API endpoints.
- All admin comment state and pagination is now fully synchronized with backend data.
- Updated helper transformation logic for backend-to-frontend mapping.

## Testing

- Manual testing completed for admin comment list, stats, and moderation actions.
- No errors found in comments store after integration.

# CHANGE LOG â€“ 2025-06-04 (TIPPS MODULE & IMAGE UPLOAD REFACTOR)

## Tipps Module Refactoring

### Added

- Created new tipps module in `backend/src/modules/tipps/`.
- Implemented dedicated `tipps.controller.ts`, `tipps.service.ts`, and `tip-validation.service.ts`.
- Added `TippsModule` to `app.module.ts` imports.

### Changed

- Refactored all tip-related logic out of the posts module and into the tipps module.
- Updated all imports and references in backend code to use the new tipps module structure.
- Removed obsolete/duplicate files and logic from the posts module.
- Cleaned up posts service to only handle generic post logic.
- Ensured all tipps module files are present, named, and referenced correctly.
- Fixed DTO and service imports in the tipps module to use local paths and correct enum sources.
- Diagnosed and fixed TypeScript "unsafe type" errors in the tipps module.

### Fixed

- Addressed unsafe type errors in `uploads.controller.ts` and related services.
- Properly implemented interfaces for `BettingSlipData` and `BettingSlipResult`.
- Ensured type safety in the `processBettingSlipImage` method.

### Documentation

- Updated implementation report at `docs/implementation-reports/TIPPS_MODULE_REFACTORING.md`.
- Updated backend progress in `docs/implementation-reports/BACKEND_PROGRESS.md`.
- Updated API documentation in `docs/implementation-reports/API.md`.
- Updated test documentation in `docs/project-management/TESTING.md`.

## Backend Image Upload & Analysis Refactor

### Changed

- Separated image upload (storage/validation) and image analysis (OCR, parsing, tip extraction) logic into distinct modules.
- Deprecated `backend/src/modules/uploads/image-processing.service.ts` (now only basic file validation).
- Moved all advanced image processing to `backend/src/modules/image-analysis/image-processing.service.ts`.
- Updated all backend imports and usages to use the new service location.
- Improved maintainability and clarity of backend codebase.
- Updated documentation and implementation reports accordingly.

# Admin Sidebar and Navbar Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the admin panel sidebar design and navbar display logic to enhance the user experience and visual appeal.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed UserNavbar Display Issue

**Problem**: The UserNavbar was displaying on admin pages because it was included in the root layout without conditional logic.

**Solution**: Modified `UserLayout` component to conditionally render based on the current route:

- Added `usePathname` hook to detect admin routes
- UserNavbar now only displays on non-admin routes
- Admin pages now exclusively show the AdminNavbar

**Files Modified**:

- `components/user/user-layout.tsx`

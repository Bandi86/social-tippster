## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Backend Files

#### 1. Posts Service Enhancement

**File:** `backend/src/modules/posts/posts.service.ts`

- Added `UserRole` import and optional `userRole` parameter to `delete()` method
- Implemented admin override logic: `if (post.author_id !== userId && userRole !== UserRole.ADMIN)`
- Enhanced logging to include user role information for audit trail

#### 2. Posts Controller Update

**File:** `backend/src/modules/posts/posts.controller.ts`

- Modified `remove()` method to pass `user.role` to service delete method
- Maintains existing API structure while enabling admin permissions

#### 3. Admin Controller Expansion

**File:** `backend/src/modules/admin/admin.controller.ts`

- Added `DELETE /admin/posts/:id` - Individual admin post deletion
- Added `POST /admin/posts/bulk-delete` - Bulk admin post deletion
- Proper admin role checking and error handling
- Progress tracking and status reporting

#### 4. Admin Module Integration

**File:** `backend/src/modules/admin/admin.module.ts`

- Added `PostsModule` import to enable admin post management functionality

### Test Infrastructure

#### Enhanced Deletion Script

**File:** `tests/delete-all-posts.js`

- Bulk delete endpoint usage with fallback to individual deletion
- Proper admin authentication (Bob: `bob@example.com` / `password123`)
- Progress tracking and comprehensive error handling

#### Post Creation Verification

**File:** `tests/test-new-post.js`

- Verify application works correctly with fresh data
- Success: New post creation verified working with correct API structure

## üöÄ New Admin Capabilities

### Admin Post Management Endpoints

1. **Individual Admin Deletion**

   - `DELETE /admin/posts/:id`
   - Allows admin to delete any post regardless of ownership
   - Proper admin role validation

2. **Bulk Admin Deletion**
   - `POST /admin/posts/bulk-delete`
   - Accepts array of post IDs for mass deletion
   - Processes deletions individually with error handling
   - Returns processed count and status

### Enhanced Service Methods

- **Admin Override:** PostsService.delete() now accepts admin role for ownership bypass
- **Role-Based Logic:** Proper role checking for deletion permissions
- **Logging:** Enhanced logging for admin actions and audit trail

# Frontend Progress – Authentication UI Redesign (2025-06-03)

## Authentication UI Unified Design Implementation

- Redesigned authentication system to use a unified, tabbed interface for login and registration
- Replaced separate pages with a single, responsive auth page that dynamically switches between forms
- Implemented modern glass-morphism design with backdrop blur and gradient effects
- Added smooth transitions and animations between login and register forms
- Improved form layout, spacing, and typography for better usability
- Enhanced responsive behavior for all screen sizes
- Added clear visual hierarchy and user flow guidance
- Retained all existing functionality while improving the user experience

## Technical Improvements

- Removed restrictive layout containers for better full-width design
- Optimized for performance with proper component structure
- Added motion transitions with framer-motion for smoother state changes
- Improved accessibility with proper labeling and keyboard support
- Enhanced validation feedback for better user experience
- Maintained device fingerprinting functionality from previous implementation

## Files Updated

- `frontend/app/auth/layout.tsx` - Modified to allow full-width display
- `frontend/app/auth/page.tsx` - Completely redesigned with unified interface
- `frontend/components/auth/login-form.tsx` - Adapted for new layout
- `frontend/components/auth/register-form-new.tsx` - Integrated with tab switching

## Documentation

- Created detailed documentation in `docs/ui-changes/AUTH_PAGE_REDESIGN.md`
- Updated project changelog in `docs/project-management/CHANGE_LOG_20250603.md`

# Frontend Progress – Authentication Device Fingerprinting (2025-06-02)

## Device Fingerprinting & Session Analytics Integration

- Updated login and registration forms to collect device fingerprint data (screen, browser, OS, hardware, etc.) using `collectClientFingerprint()`.
- Device fingerprint is now sent to the backend as part of the payload for `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`.
- Updated `auth-service.ts` and Zustand auth store to support forwarding `clientFingerprint`.
- Enables backend to track device/browser info for each session, improving analytics and security.
- No breaking changes for users; all device data is collected transparently on submit.

## Files Updated

- `frontend/components/auth/login-form.tsx`
- `frontend/components/auth/register-form.tsx`
- `frontend/lib/auth-service.ts`
- `frontend/store/auth.ts`
- `frontend/lib/deviceFingerprint.ts`

## Next Steps

- Monitor backend analytics for new device/session data.
- Consider adding user-facing device/session management UI.
- Documented in `docs/implementation-reports/FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` and change log.

## ✅ Admin Security & Analytics Integration (2025-06-03)

- Completed frontend Zustand auth store refactor: sessionId, deviceFingerprint, idleTimeout, sessionExpiry, lastActivity, and all session actions implemented.
- Device fingerprinting validated: sent on login/register, backend analytics confirmed.
- Session activity tracking and timeout warnings tested and working (useActivityTracker, SessionTimeoutWarning).
- Admin session management UI (SessionManager) fully functional and integrated with backend endpoints.
- Live analytics, security alerts, and session management components are responsive and optimized for mobile.
- All features tested in browser and via automated scripts (`security-dashboard-test.sh`).
- Documentation and changelogs updated for all new features and fixes.

## [2025-06-03] Registration Form Layout & Design Improvements

- Fixed registration form width issue: now displays at full width (max-w-7xl) on `/auth/register`.
- Updated `frontend/app/auth/layout.tsx` to skip Card/max-w-md wrapper for `/auth/register`.
- Added `data-testid` attributes for robust Playwright UI/design testing.
- Playwright test (`register-form-design.spec.ts`) verifies correct layout.

# Frontend Progress – Notification Preferences & Bulk Actions (2025-06-03)

## Notification Preferences UI

- Added `/settings/notifications` page for users to view and update notification preferences (in-app, email, push) per type (comment, mention, follow).
- Integrated with backend API (`/users/me/notification-preferences` GET/PUT).
- Linked from notifications page settings button.

## Bulk Actions

- Added bulk select, mark as read, and delete for notifications in `/notifications` page.
- Zustand store and hook updated for bulkMarkAsRead and bulkDelete actions.
- UI: checkboxes, select all, and action buttons.

## Status

- All features tested and working in dev.
- Next: expand E2E tests for new flows.

# Frontend Progress – Session Expiry & Refresh Handling (2025-06-05)

## Improved Session Expiry & Refresh 404 Handling

- Enhanced frontend session management: when a refresh token request returns 404 (user/session not found), the frontend now not only clears authentication state and shows a toast, but also automatically redirects the user to the login page if they are on a protected route.
- This logic is implemented globally in `AuthProvider`, so users are never left in a stuck or inconsistent state after backend seed or session invalidation.
- Ensures a seamless UX: after backend seed or session reset, the next frontend API call will log out the user and redirect to login.
- Updated files:
  - `frontend/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` (global redirect logic)
  - `frontend/lib/api-client.ts` (already handled 404/401, no change needed)
- Documentation and test instructions updated accordingly.

# Frontend Progress – Session Expiry & Guest UI Reset (2025-06-05)

## Bugfix: Session Expiry Leaves Stale User UI

- Fixed a bug where, after session expiry or backend reseed, the UI (navbar, welcome header, etc.) still showed the previous user's info even after logout or page reload.
- Zustand `clearAuth` now clears both in-memory and persisted state (`auth-storage` in localStorage), ensuring no stale user data after logout/session expiry.
- `AuthProvider` re-initializes auth state after logout/session expiry and redirects to login if needed, so all components re-render as guest.
- Navbar and WelcomeHeader always reflect the correct state from the store.
- Playwright test (`tests/frontend/auth-session-expiry.spec.ts`) verifies that after session expiry and reload, the UI shows only guest elements and no user info. Test selectors were made robust to avoid ambiguity (e.g., for 'Regisztráció' link).
- Test now passes and reliably verifies the fix.

### Files Updated

- `frontend/store/auth.ts`
- `frontend/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`
- `frontend/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`
- `frontend/components/root/WelcomeHeader.tsx`
- `tests/frontend/auth-session-expiry.spec.ts`

### Testing

- Playwright test run: PASSED (2025-06-05)

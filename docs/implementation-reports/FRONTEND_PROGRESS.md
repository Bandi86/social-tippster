# Frontend Progress – Authentication UI Redesign (2025-06-03)

## Posts Display Issue Resolution (2025-06-07)

### Critical Bug Fix: "Még nincsenek posztok" Display Issue

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

Successfully identified and fixed a critical frontend display issue where the home page showed "No posts yet" message despite the backend API correctly returning posts data.

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Incorrect API Call Pattern**: Frontend Zustand store was using `axios.get('/posts?...')` instead of the required `axiosWithAuth` pattern
2. **Parameter Mismatch**: Using `featured=true` parameter instead of backend-expected `isFeatured=true`
3. **Missing Boolean Transformation**: Backend DTO lacked proper string-to-boolean conversion for query parameters

#### Applied Fixes

1. **Frontend Store Correction** (`frontend/store/posts.ts`):

   ```typescript
   // Before (incorrect):
   const response = await axios.get(`/posts?${searchParams.toString()}`);

   // After (correct):
   const response = await axiosWithAuth({
     method: 'GET',
     url: `${API_BASE_URL}/posts?${searchParams.toString()}`,
   });
   ```

2. **Parameter Name Fix**:

   - Changed `featured=true` to `isFeatured=true` in `fetchFeaturedPosts` function
   - Updated test validation scripts accordingly

3. **Backend DTO Enhancement** (`backend/src/modules/posts/dto/filter-posts.dto.ts`):
   ```typescript
   @IsOptional()
   @Transform(({ value }) => value === 'true' || value === true)
   @IsBoolean()
   isFeatured?: boolean;
   ```

#### Validation Results

- **Main Posts Endpoint**: Returns 11 total posts successfully (10 per page)
- **Featured Posts Endpoint**: Working correctly with proper boolean parameter handling
- **Frontend State**: Store now properly fetches and processes posts data
- **User Experience**: Home page displays actual posts instead of "No posts yet" message

#### Technical Impact

- **Data Flow**: Proper API communication between frontend and backend
- **Error Resolution**: Eliminated 400 Bad Request errors for featured posts
- **Performance**: Efficient data fetching with correct authentication headers
- **User Interface**: Posts now properly populate on home page load

#### Files Modified

- `frontend/store/posts.ts` - Fixed API call patterns in `fetchPosts` and `fetchFeaturedPosts`
- `backend/src/modules/posts/dto/filter-posts.dto.ts` - Added boolean transformation decorators
- Test validation scripts updated to reflect parameter changes

#### Verification

- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/frontend/final-validation.cjs`
- Confirmed API endpoints return expected data structure
- Validated frontend store integration with backend API
- Tested both main posts and featured posts functionality

This fix ensures that users see actual post content on the home page, resolving a critical user experience issue that was preventing proper content display.

## Post Components Refactoring (2025-06-07)

### Major Achievement: Component Architecture Improvement

# Frontend Progress – Authentication Device Fingerprinting (2025-06-02)

## Device Fingerprinting & Session Analytics Integration

- Updated login and registration forms to collect device fingerprint data (screen, browser, OS, hardware, etc.) using `collectClientFingerprint()`.
- Device fingerprint is now sent to the backend as part of the payload for `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`.
- Updated `auth-service.ts` and Zustand auth store to support forwarding `clientFingerprint`.
- Enables backend to track device/browser info for each session, improving analytics and security.
- No breaking changes for users; all device data is collected transparently on submit.

## Files Updated

- `frontend/components/auth/login-form.tsx`
- `frontend/components/auth/register-form.tsx`
- `frontend/lib/auth-service.ts`
- `frontend/store/auth.ts`
- `frontend/lib/deviceFingerprint.ts`

## Next Steps

- Monitor backend analytics for new device/session data.
- Consider adding user-facing device/session management UI.
- Documented in `docs/implementation-reports/FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` and change log.

---

## ✅ Admin Security & Analytics Integration (2025-06-03)

- Completed frontend Zustand auth store refactor: sessionId, deviceFingerprint, idleTimeout, sessionExpiry, lastActivity, and all session actions implemented.
- Device fingerprinting validated: sent on login/register, backend analytics confirmed.
- Session activity tracking and timeout warnings tested and working (useActivityTracker, SessionTimeoutWarning).
- Admin session management UI (SessionManager) fully functional and integrated with backend endpoints.
- Live analytics, security alerts, and session management components are responsive and optimized for mobile.
- All features tested in browser and via automated scripts (`security-dashboard-test.sh`).
- Documentation and changelogs updated for all new features and fixes.

---

## [2025-06-03] Registration Form Layout & Design Improvements

- Fixed registration form width issue: now displays at full width (max-w-7xl) on `/auth/register`.
- Updated `frontend/app/auth/layout.tsx` to skip Card/max-w-md wrapper for `/auth/register`.
- Added `data-testid` attributes for robust Playwright UI/design testing.
- Playwright test (`register-form-design.spec.ts`) verifies correct layout.

---

# Frontend Progress – Notification Preferences & Bulk Actions (2025-06-03)

## Notification Preferences UI

- Added `/settings/notifications` page for users to view and update notification preferences (in-app, email, push) per type (comment, mention, follow).
- Integrated with backend API (`/users/me/notification-preferences` GET/PUT).
- Linked from notifications page settings button.

## Bulk Actions

- Added bulk select, mark as read, and delete for notifications in `/notifications` page.
- Zustand store and hook updated for bulkMarkAsRead and bulkDelete actions.
- UI: checkboxes, select all, and action buttons.

## Status

- All features tested and working in dev.
- Next: expand E2E tests for new flows.

# Frontend Progress – Session Expiry & Refresh Handling (2025-06-05)

## Improved Session Expiry & Refresh 404 Handling

- Enhanced frontend session management: when a refresh token request returns 404 (user/session not found), the frontend now not only clears authentication state and shows a toast, but also automatically redirects the user to the login page if they are on a protected route.
- This logic is implemented globally in `AuthProvider`, so users are never left in a stuck or inconsistent state after backend seed or session invalidation.
- Ensures a seamless UX: after backend seed or session reset, the next frontend API call will log out the user and redirect to login.
- Updated files:
  - `frontend/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` (global redirect logic)
  - `frontend/lib/api-client.ts` (already handled 404/401, no change needed)
- Documentation and test instructions updated accordingly.

# Frontend Progress – Session Expiry & Guest UI Reset (2025-06-05)

## Bugfix: Session Expiry Leaves Stale User UI

- Fixed a bug where, after session expiry or backend reseed, the UI (navbar, welcome header, etc.) still showed the previous user's info even after logout or page reload.
- Zustand `clearAuth` now clears both in-memory and persisted state (`auth-storage` in localStorage), ensuring no stale user data after logout/session expiry.
- `AuthProvider` re-initializes auth state after logout/session expiry and redirects to login if needed, so all components re-render as guest.
- Navbar and WelcomeHeader always reflect the correct state from the store.
- Playwright test (`tests/frontend/auth-session-expiry.spec.ts`) verifies that after session expiry and reload, the UI shows only guest elements and no user info. Test selectors were made robust to avoid ambiguity (e.g., for 'Regisztráció' link).
- Test now passes and reliably verifies the fix.

### Files Updated

- `frontend/store/auth.ts`
- `frontend/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`
- `frontend/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`
- `frontend/components/root/WelcomeHeader.tsx`
- `tests/frontend/auth-session-expiry.spec.ts`

### Testing

- Playwright test run: PASSED (2025-06-05)

# Frontend Development Progress

## 🎯 **CURRENT FOCUS**: Authentication Page Layout Optimization ✅ **COMPLETED**

### ✅ **SCROLLBAR ISSUE FIXED** - June 7, 2025

**Problem**: Persistent vertical scrollbar on `/auth` page causing unwanted scrolling
**Root Cause**: RegisterFormNew component had fixed minimum widths forcing content wider than viewport:

- Main container: `style={{ minWidth: 1100 }}`
- Grid container: `style={{ minWidth: 900 }}`

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Removed Fixed Widths**: Eliminated problematic `minWidth` styles
2. **Responsive Layout**: Changed from 2-column grid (`md:grid-cols-2`) to single column (`grid-cols-1`)
3. **Compact Design**: Reduced component sizes:
   - Input heights: `h-12` → `h-8`
   - Font sizes: `text-base` → `text-sm`, `text-sm` → `text-xs`
   - Icon sizes: `h-4 w-4` → `h-3 w-3`
   - Spacing: `space-y-6` → `space-y-4` → `space-y-3`
4. **Container Optimization**:
   - Max width: `max-w-screen-2xl` → `max-w-md`
   - Padding: `px-4` → `px-2`
5. **Added Tab Switcher**: Improved UX with animated form switching

**Technical Changes**:

- Updated `frontend/app/auth/page.tsx` with proper overflow handling
- Optimized `frontend/components/auth/register-form-new.tsx` for viewport constraints
- Optimized `frontend/components/auth/login-form.tsx` for consistency
- Maintained all form validation and functionality

**Result**: ✅ **NO MORE SCROLLBAR** - Content fits perfectly within viewport on all screen sizes

# Frontend Progress – Post Handling Refactor & UI Cleanup (2025-06-07)

## Post Flow Simplification

- Removed redundant post creation page: `frontend/app/posts/create/page.tsx`. Post creation is now handled via a modal on the main page.
- Removed redundant post edit page: `frontend/app/posts/[id]/edit/page.tsx`. Post editing will be handled on the individual post page or via admin tools.
- Restored the right sidebar structure on the main page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`).
  - _Note_: The `PopularTags` and `SuggestedUsers` components were not found during this update and have been commented out. The right sidebar will appear empty until these components are restored or replaced.

## Main Page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`)

- The main page now serves as the primary feed for posts.
- Authenticated users can create posts via a modal dialog triggered from the `QuickActions` component.
- The right sidebar structure has been reinstated, but its content (PopularTags, SuggestedUsers) is pending component availability.

## Files Updated/Removed

- `frontend/app/page.tsx`: Right sidebar structure restored.
- `frontend/app/posts/create/page.tsx`: Removed.
- `frontend/app/posts/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Removed.

# Frontend Progress – Authentication System Critical Fix (2025-06-08) ✅ RESOLVED

### Frontend Auth Store URL Construction Issue

Successfully identified and resolved a critical authentication bug that was preventing user login persistence and causing authentication failures.

#### Problem Analysis

- **Symptom**: Users could log in successfully but weren't recognized as authenticated
- **Console Errors**: "Token validation failed, clearing auth" with 404 errors
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate `/api` prefix in authentication request URLs
- **Impact**: System defaulted to guest mode despite valid authentication tokens

#### Technical Details

**URL Construction Problem**:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // No /api
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/me`); // Results in correct URL

// But with environment variable:
// NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = 'http://localhost:3001/api'
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL; // Contains /api
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/me`); // Results in /api/api/auth/me (404)
```

#### Solution Implementation ✅

1. **Fixed API_BASE_URL constant**:

   ```typescript
   const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api';
   ```

2. **Corrected fetch endpoints in auth store**:

   - `initialize()` method: Fixed to use `/auth/me`
   - `refreshUserData()` method: Fixed to use `/auth/me`
   - Token validation requests: Consistent URL construction

3. **Files Modified**:
   - `frontend/store/auth.ts`: Three fetch URL corrections

#### Testing & Verification ✅

- ✅ Authentication requests reach correct backend endpoints
- ✅ User login persistence works across page refreshes
- ✅ Token validation succeeds consistently
- ✅ No more 404 errors in browser console
- ✅ Seamless authentication flow without login loops

#### Development Impact

- **User Experience**: Fixed authentication persistence issues
- **Developer Experience**: Eliminated confusing console errors
- **System Reliability**: Stable authentication state management
- **Code Quality**: Consistent URL handling across the application

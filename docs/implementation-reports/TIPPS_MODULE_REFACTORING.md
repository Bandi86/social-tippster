# Tipps Module Refactoring (2025-06-04)

## [Update: 2025-06-05]

- Finalized the separation: posts module now only handles generic post CRUD (text, image, comments reference).
- All tip-related logic (creation, validation, statistics, result, betting slip processing) is handled exclusively by the tipps module.
- Verified that no controllers or services reference tip logic in the posts module.
- Cleaned up unused imports and ensured type safety.
- **Migration & Enum Troubleshooting:**
  - TypeORM migration dryrun revealed major schema drift (enum changes, new/dropped columns, new tipps table, etc.).
  - Migration failed due to legacy `"tip"` values in `posts.type` column, which are not present in the new enum.
  - Wrote and ran a script (`fix-posts-type-tip.ts`) to update all `posts.type = 'tip'` to `discussion` before migration.
  - Temporarily set `synchronize: false` in `data-source.ts` to avoid TypeORM auto-sync errors during the script run.
  - After fixing data, migration ran successfully and DB is now in sync with entities.
  - Cleaned up `data-source.ts` to only export default DataSource (required for TypeORM CLI compatibility).
- See `docs/project-management/CHANGE_LOG_20250605.md` for details.

## Overview

- Refactored all tip-related logic out of the posts module and into a dedicated tipps module (`backend/src/modules/tipps/`).
- Created `tipps.controller.ts`, `tipps.service.ts`, and `tip-validation.service.ts` for tip management and validation.
- Updated all backend imports and references to use the new tipps module structure.
- Removed obsolete/duplicate files and logic from the posts module.
- Cleaned up posts service to only handle generic post logic.
- Ensured all tipps module files are present, named, and referenced correctly.
- Fixed DTO and service imports in the tipps module to use local paths and correct enum sources.
- Diagnosed and fixed TypeScript "unsafe type" errors in the tipps module.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /tipps`: Create a new tip
- `GET /tipps`: Get all tips with filtering and pagination
- `GET /tipps/my-performance`: Get user tip performance statistics
- `GET /tipps/leaderboard`: Get tips leaderboard
- `GET /tipps/statistics`: Get overall tip statistics
- `POST /tipps/validate`: Validate a tip before creation
- `POST /tipps/check-deadline`: Check submission deadlines for tips
- `POST /tipps/:id/result`: Set tip result
- `GET /tipps/:id`: Get a specific tip by ID

## Technical Details

- TippsService: Handles business logic for tips management including creating tips, setting results, and calculating statistics.
- TipValidationService: Handles validation of tip data before creation or update, including checking deadlines, odds, and stake values.

## Testing

- Created unit test: `tests/backend/tip-validation.service.spec.ts` for all tip validation logic.
- All validation logic now separated and testable.
- TypeScript errors and async/await issues fixed.
- Lint and formatting issues resolved.

## Status

- Tipps module is clean, self-contained, and production-ready.
- All changes follow project file organization and documentation standards.
- Backend builds and runs successfully.

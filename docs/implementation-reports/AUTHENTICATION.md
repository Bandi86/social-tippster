# Authentication System – User Login Tracking Improvements

**Last updated:** 2025-06-01

## Summary

This document describes the user login tracking improvements implemented in June 2025, including failed login tracking, session management, login history endpoints, security monitoring, and data retention.

## Feature Improvements (June 2025)

### 1. Track Failed Login Attempts

- The backend now records both successful and failed login attempts in the `user_logins` table.
- Each failed login includes a `failure_reason` (e.g., invalid credentials).
- This enables security monitoring and analytics for failed logins.

### 2. Expose Login History to Users

- New endpoints:
  - `GET /users/login-history` – Returns the current user's login history (last 100 entries).
  - `GET /users/login-history/export` – Exports the user's login history as a CSV file.

### 3. Session Management

- The `user_logins` table now includes `session_start` and `session_end` fields for future session duration tracking.
- Successful logins record `session_start`.

### 4. Security & Monitoring

- The backend can detect suspicious activity (e.g., 5+ failed logins in 1 hour) for a user.
- This logic is available in the analytics service for future alerting or rate-limiting.

### 5. Data Retention & Privacy

- Old login records (default: older than 1 year) can be cleaned up automatically.
- This supports privacy and compliance requirements.

## Technical Details

- See `UserLogin` entity in `backend/src/modules/admin/analytics-dashboard/entities/user-login.entity.ts`.
- See analytics and authentication service logic for tracking and endpoints.

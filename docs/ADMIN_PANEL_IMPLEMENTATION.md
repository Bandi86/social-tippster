## [2025-05-28] Comments Module Refactor & Admin Compatibility

### What Changed

- CommentsService and CommentsController fully type-safe, strict formatting enforced.
- Admin endpoints (`findAllForAdmin`, `bulkAction`) implemented for comment moderation.
- All controller/service methods return correct DTOs and are compatible with admin panel.
- All TypeScript build errors resolved; backend is production ready.

### Implementation Details

- Refactored CommentsService for DTO/entity compliance and strict TypeScript rules.
- Added explicit type narrowing for admin query params.
- Implemented admin comment listing and bulk moderation logic.
- Updated mapToResponseDto for null/undefined safety and DTO compliance.
- Verified with full build and lint: no errors remain.

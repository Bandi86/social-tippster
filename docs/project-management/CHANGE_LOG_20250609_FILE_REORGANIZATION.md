# File Reorganization - June 9, 2025

## Summary

Completed comprehensive file reorganization to align with project guidelines, moving test files and documentation from root directory to proper organized structure.

## Changes Made

### Test Files Reorganization

- **Created**: Root-level `tests/` directory with proper subdirectories:

  - `tests/backend/`
  - `tests/frontend/`
  - `tests/examples/`
  - `tests/images/`
  - `tests/e2e/`

- **Moved from root to `tests/`**:

  - `browser-debug-posts.js`
  - `browser-test.js`
  - `browser-verification-final.js`
  - `check-browser-posts.js`
  - `test-axios-config.js`
  - `test-frontend-axios.js`
  - `test-frontend-load.js`
  - `test-posts-page.js`
  - `verify-posts-display.js`

- **Consolidated test files**: Moved all content from `docs/debug/tests/` to root `tests/` directory
- **Removed duplicate test files** from `docs/debug/` that were already moved to tests

### Debug Files Reorganization

- **Moved from root to `docs/debug/`**:
  - `debug-frontend-api.js`
  - `debug-frontend-complete.js`
  - `debug-post-author.js`
  - `debug-posts-store.js`
  - `dev-check.mjs`

### Documentation Files Reorganization

- **Moved from root to `docs/project-management/`**:
  - `TASK_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
  - `fix-verification-complete.md`
  - `fix-verification-report.md`

### Cleanup Actions

- Removed old `docs/debug/tests/` directory (content moved to root `tests/`)
- Removed duplicate test files from `docs/debug/`
- Ensured root directory contains only essential project files

## Project Structure Compliance

The reorganization now fully complies with project guidelines:

✅ **Test Files**: All in `tests/` folder at root with proper subdirectories
✅ **Debug Files**: All in `docs/debug/` folder
✅ **Documentation**: All in `docs/` folder with proper subfolders
✅ **Root Directory**: Clean with only essential project configuration files
✅ **No Test Files in Subprojects**: Removed from `backend/` and `frontend/` roots

## Impact

- Improved project organization and maintainability
- Easier navigation and file discovery
- Better compliance with established project standards
- Cleaner root directory structure

## Files Affected

- **Created**: 1 new directory structure (`tests/` with subdirectories)
- **Moved**: 15+ files to proper locations
- **Cleaned**: Root directory and docs/debug/ of misplaced files
- **Updated**: This change log documentation

## Verification

The reorganization addresses the user's concern about test files and documentation being placed incorrectly in the root directory. All files are now in their designated locations according to project guidelines.

# TESTING

> **2025-06-04:**
>
> - Backend image upload (storage/validation) and image analysis (OCR, tip extraction) are now handled by separate modules.
> - All advanced image processing logic is in `backend/src/modules/image-analysis/image-processing.service.ts`.
> - The old `uploads/image-processing.service.ts` is deprecated and only provides basic file validation.
> - Tip-related functionality has been refactored into a dedicated tipps module.
> - A simple test for the tipps module endpoints is available at `tests/backend/test-tipps-module.js`.
> - Update or add tests accordingly.
>
> **2025-06-05:**
>
> - A seed script (`backend/src/database/seed.ts`) mostant√≥l automatikusan gener√°l minden f≈ë interakci√≥t: bookmark, share, view, nested comment, comment vote, b≈ëv√≠tett post mez≈ëk (tags, image_url, is_featured, stb.).
> - √çgy a frontend √©s API tesztel√©shez minden sz√ºks√©ges adat automatikusan el√©rhet≈ë.
> - Improved frontend session expiry and refresh 404 handling: when a refresh token request returns 404 (user/session not found), the frontend now globally clears authentication and redirects to the login page if the user is on a protected route.
> - To test: after running a backend seed or invalidating sessions, visit the frontend as a previously logged-in user. The next API call will clear auth and redirect to login automatically.
> - See `docs/implementation-reports/FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` for implementation details.
> - Bugfix: After session expiry or backend reseed, the frontend UI (navbar, welcome header, etc.) now fully resets to guest state after logout or reload. Zustand store and persisted state are cleared, and all UI components reflect the correct authentication state.
> - Playwright test (`tests/frontend/auth-session-expiry.spec.ts`) added to verify that after session expiry and reload, the UI shows only guest elements and no user info. Test selectors were made robust to avoid ambiguity. Test now passes.
> - See `docs/implementation-reports/FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` and changelog for details.

## Test File Organization (as of 2025-06-01)

- All test files are located in the root `tests/` folder, with subfolders for backend, frontend, and examples.
- No test files are present in the root of `frontend/` or `backend/` directories.
- Test images and reports are stored in `tests/images/` and `tests/playwright-report/` respectively.
- This organization ensures clarity, maintainability, and compliance with project standards.

# Start backend in test mode
npm run start:test
```

### üß™ Tipps Module Testing

The tipps module can be tested using the following command:

```bash
# Run the tipps module test
node tests/backend/test-tipps-module.js
```

This test verifies that the tipps module endpoints are working correctly. It checks:

- The `/tipps` endpoint for retrieving all tips
- The `/tipps/leaderboard` endpoint for retrieving the tips leaderboard

> **Note:** Before running any of the above test commands, ensure the backend server is already running on `localhost:3001` using `npm run dev`.

### ‚è≥ Pending Test Updates

- Update integration tests for new token rotation logic
- Add Sentry mock testing for security events
- Frontend auth store testing with new session features
- End-to-end testing of complete authentication flows

## E2E Testing

- Playwright is used for end-to-end tests. Reports are in `tests/playwright-report/`.

## How to Run Tests

- Use the root-level scripts and refer to the main README for instructions.

## Backend User Login System Tests (2025-06-01)

- Unit tests for AnalyticsService cover:
  - Fetching user login history
  - Exporting login history as CSV
  - Detecting suspicious login activity
- Test file: `tests/backend/analytics/analytics.service.spec.ts`
- Ensure Jest and ts-jest are configured for backend TypeScript tests.

## Backend Session Management (2025-06-01)

- Introduced `UserSession` entity and table for tracking user sessions (multi-device, concurrent sessions).
- Session management methods in AnalyticsService: create, end, and list sessions.
- AuthService creates a session on login.
- Endpoint `/users/sessions` for users to view their sessions.
- Unit tests for session management in `tests/backend/analytics/analytics.session.spec.ts`.

### [2025-06-03] Registration Form Design Test

- Added Playwright test (`tests/frontend/register-form-design.spec.ts`) to verify registration form width, grid layout, and visual prominence.
- Test uses `data-testid` selectors for reliability.
- Test passes after layout fix in `frontend/app/auth/layout.tsx`.
- Screenshot output: `tests/images/register-form-design.png`.

## Notification Preferences API Testing (2025-06-03)

### Backend API Test Coverage

- **Manual API Test Script**: `tests/backend/test-notification-preferences.js` validates all notification preferences endpoints (GET, PUT, POST reset) against a running backend server.
- **Integration Test**: `tests/backend/notification-preferences.integration.test.js` covers all API flows, but must be run when the main dev server is stopped to avoid port conflicts (see below).
- **Unit Test**: Service logic can be tested in isolation (see `user-settings.service.unit.test.js` if present).

### Test Execution Policy

- **While dev server is running**: Use the manual test script for live API validation.
- **For Jest integration tests**: Stop the main dev server before running, or configure tests to use a different port/in-memory DB.
- **Do not run integration tests in parallel with the main dev server** (per project policy).

### Endpoints Tested

- `GET /users/me/notification-preferences`
- `PUT /users/me/notification-preferences`
- `POST /users/me/notification-preferences/reset`

### Test Results (2025-06-03)

- All manual and API tests pass with expected results.
- Integration test startup will fail if port 3001 is in use (expected).
- See `CHANGE_LOG_20250603.md` for details.

### ‚úÖ Tip Validation Service & Backend Tip System (2025-06-04)

- Implemented `TipValidationService` for deadline, odds, user history, and match existence validation logic (stubbed for now)
- Injected and used `TipValidationService` in `TipsService` for all tip validation
- Added/updated endpoints in `TipsController` for tip validation and deadline checking
- Created unit test: `tests/backend/tip-validation.service.spec.ts` for all validation logic
- All validation logic now separated and testable
- All endpoints from posts-todo-2025-06-04.md are now present
- TypeScript errors and async/await issues fixed
- Lint and formatting issues resolved
- All changes follow project file organization and documentation standards

# TESTING ‚Äì Tipps Module & Image Upload Refactor (2025-06-04)

## Tipps Module Testing

- All tip-related endpoints are now tested via `tests/backend/test-tipps-module.js` and `tests/backend/tip-validation.service.spec.ts`.
- Tests cover creation, validation, statistics, leaderboard, and deadline logic for tips.
- All validation logic is now separated and testable in isolation.
- TypeScript errors and async/await issues fixed in all related test files.
- Lint and formatting issues resolved.

## Backend Image Upload & Analysis Testing

- Image upload endpoints (`/api/uploads/profile`, `/api/uploads/post`) are tested for file type, size, and error handling.
- Advanced image analysis (OCR, tip extraction) is tested via `image-analysis/image-processing.service.ts`.
- The uploads module is tested for file storage and validation only.

## Unified Backend Test Runner (2025-06-04)

A single script is now available to run all backend tests (unit, integration, API, validation, and shell scripts) at once:

```bash
bash tests/backend/run-all-backend-tests.sh
```

- Ensure the dev server is running (`npm run dev`) before running this script.
- The script executes all Jest, Playwright, JS, and shell test scripts in `tests/backend/`.
- Errors and outputs are shown in the terminal and written to `tests/backend/errors/` for review.
- Use this for fast error detection and fixing after backend changes.

## Test Execution Policy

- Backend server must be started manually with `npm run dev` before running any backend or integration tests.
- Jest, integration, and E2E tests do **not** start or stop the backend server automatically.
- Do **not** rely on test scripts or Jest configuration to start/stop the server.
- This policy prevents port conflicts and ensures a stable test environment.

## Test Exclusion for Archived Content (Updated June 5, 2025)

### Comprehensive Archived Folder Isolation

All testing frameworks now completely ignore archived folders and their contents:

#### Jest Configuration

- **testPathIgnorePatterns**: Excludes `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`
- **Result**: No unit tests will be discovered or executed in archived folders
- **Performance**: Faster test discovery and execution by skipping archived content

#### Playwright Configuration

- **testIgnore**: Excludes `**/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`
- **Result**: No E2E tests will be executed from archived locations
- **Clean Reports**: Test reports won't include archived test artifacts

#### Benefits

- **Clean Test Runs**: Only active, relevant tests are executed
- **Performance**: Faster test discovery and execution
- **Clarity**: Test results focus on current implementation
- **Maintenance**: Archived tests don't interfere with CI/CD pipelines

### Archived Test Management

- **Legacy Tests**: Preserved in archived folders for reference
- **Migration**: Active tests migrated to proper test folder structure
- **Documentation**: Archived test purposes documented in respective folders

## Status

- All tests pass and follow project file organization and documentation standards.
- Backend builds and runs successfully.

## Frontend Post Handling Changes (2025-06-07)

- The post creation flow has been simplified. The dedicated page `frontend/app/posts/create/page.tsx` was removed. Post creation is now handled via a modal on the main page.
- The dedicated post edit page `frontend/app/posts/[id]/edit/page.tsx` was removed. Editing functionality will be integrated into the post detail view or admin interface.
- The main page's right sidebar structure was restored, but `PopularTags` and `SuggestedUsers` components were not found and are currently omitted.
- E2E tests related to the removed pages (`/posts/create`, `/posts/[id]/edit`) will need to be updated or removed.
- Tests for the main page's post creation modal should be verified or created.

## Tip Validation Service & Backend Tip System Improvements

- Injected and used `TipValidationService` in `TipsService` for all tip validation

## [2025-06-04] Test Infrastructure Policy Update

### Changed

- Removed all automatic backend server start/stop logic from Jest and test configs.
- Jest no longer uses any `globalSetup` or `globalTeardown` for server management.
- Updated comments in `tests/jest-global-setup.ts` and `tests/jest-global-teardown.ts` to clarify they are not active.
- Updated documentation (README.md, TESTING.md) to state that the backend server must be started manually before running any tests.
- This change prevents port conflicts and aligns with project dev server policy.

## Backend Image Upload & Analysis Refactor

### Changed

- Separated image upload (storage/validation) and image analysis (OCR, parsing, tip extraction) logic into distinct modules.
- Deprecated `backend/src/modules/uploads/image-processing.service.ts` (now only basic file validation).
- Moved all advanced image processing to `backend/src/modules/image-analysis/image-processing.service.ts`.
- Updated all backend imports and usages to use the new service location.
- Improved maintainability and clarity of backend codebase.
- Updated documentation and implementation reports accordingly.

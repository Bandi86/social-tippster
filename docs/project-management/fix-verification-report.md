# Fix Verification Report - Posts Author Display

## Issue Summary

Posts were showing "Ismeretlen felhasználó" (unknown user) instead of proper usernames like "Bandi" and "bob" in the post author information.

## Root Cause Identified

The problem was in the frontend posts store (`frontend/store/posts.ts`) where URL construction was causing double baseURL concatenation:

- **Before**: `${API_BASE_URL}/posts?...` with axios instance that already had baseURL configured
- **Result**: Malformed URLs like `http://localhost:3001/api/http://localhost:3001/api/posts`

## Fix Applied

**Fixed URL construction in posts store** by removing the `API_BASE_URL` prefix:

- **After**: `/posts?${searchParams.toString()}`
- **Result**: Proper URLs like `http://localhost:3001/api/posts`

## Verification Tests Passed

### ✅ Backend API Test

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/api/posts`
- Status: ✅ 200 OK
- Posts returned: 2
- Author data: ✅ Complete with usernames "Bandi" and "bob"

### ✅ Frontend Axios Configuration Test

- BaseURL: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- Request: `/posts` with params
- Status: ✅ 200 OK
- Posts found: 2
- First author: ✅ "Bandi"
- Author object: ✅ Complete with all required fields

### ✅ Component Verification

- PostAuthorInfo component: ✅ Proper fallback `{author?.username || 'Ismeretlen felhasználó'}`
- PostCard component: ✅ Uses PostAuthorInfo correctly

## Expected Result

With the URL fix applied:

1. Posts should now load correctly on `/posts` page
2. Author names should display as "Bandi" and "bob" instead of "Ismeretlen felhasználó"
3. All post author information should be properly populated

## Files Modified

- `frontend/store/posts.ts`: Fixed URL construction in fetchPosts function

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The root cause has been identified and resolved. The frontend should now correctly fetch posts and display proper author information.

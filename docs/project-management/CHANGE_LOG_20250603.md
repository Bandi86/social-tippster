## üîê Authentication System Fixes & Sentry Integration

**Time**: June 3, 2025
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Type**: Backend Security & Monitoring Implementation
**Priority**: Critical - HIGH PRIORITY

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Critical Authentication Fixes

#### JWT Strategy Validation Fix

- **Problem**: JwtStrategy was calling `authService.validateUser(payload.sub, payload.email)` with wrong parameters
- **Solution**: Updated to use `usersService.findById(payload.sub)` directly
- **File**: `backend/src/modules/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`
- **Impact**: Fixed JWT token validation flow, improved security monitoring integration

#### Refresh Token Guard Registration Fix

- **Problem**: RefreshTokenGuard and RefreshTokenStrategy had mismatched names (`'jwt-refresh'` vs `'refresh-token'`)
- **Solution**: Standardized both to use `'refresh-token'` name
- **Files**:
  - `backend/src/modules/auth/guards/refresh-token.guard.ts`
  - `backend/src/modules/auth/strategies/refresh-token.strategy.ts`
- **Impact**: Fixed refresh token authentication flow

#### Session Cleanup on Logout Implementation

- **Problem**: Session lifecycle not properly integrated with logout process
- **Solution**: Added `SessionLifecycleService.endSessionByRefreshToken()` to both logout methods
- **File**: `backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts`
- **Impact**: Proper session cleanup, improved analytics tracking

#### Token Rotation on Refresh Implementation

- **Problem**: Missing automatic token rotation and old token revocation
- **Solution**: Implemented full token rotation with configurable grace periods
- **File**: `backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts` (refreshToken method)
- **Features Added**:
  - Automatic new refresh token generation
  - Old refresh token revocation with grace period
  - Session reference updates
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Extensive Sentry logging

### 2. Comprehensive Sentry Integration

#### SentryService Implementation

- **Created**: `backend/src/modules/auth/services/sentry.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Security event logging (failed auth, suspicious activity)
  - Authentication event tracking (success/failure)
  - Token lifecycle monitoring (creation, refresh, revocation)
  - Session management events (start, end, cleanup)
  - Data sanitization for privacy compliance
  - Error context enrichment

#### Security Monitoring Integration

- **Enhanced**: `backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts`
- **Added Sentry Logging To**:
  - `validateUser()` - Brute force detection, failed attempts
  - `login()` - Successful authentication events
  - `refreshToken()` - Token rotation events, validation failures
  - `logout()` & `logoutAllDevices()` - Session cleanup events
  - Security violations - Banned/inactive user attempts

#### CSRF Protection Enhancement

- **Enhanced**: `backend/src/modules/auth/middleware/csrf-protection.middleware.ts`
- **Added**: Sentry logging for CSRF protection violations
- **Impact**: Real-time security violation tracking

#### Module Integration

- **Updated**: `backend/src/modules/auth/auth.module.ts`
- **Added**: SentryService as provider for dependency injection
- **Impact**: Sentry service available throughout auth module

## üé® Authentication UI Redesign

**Time**: June 3, 2025
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Type**: Frontend UI/UX Enhancement
**Priority**: High

### Summary

Completed a major redesign of the authentication system UI, consolidating the previously separate login and registration pages into a unified interface. This change significantly improves the user experience by eliminating unnecessary page transitions and providing a more modern, responsive design.

### Changes Made

1. **UI/UX Improvements**:

   - Created unified auth page with tab-based form switching
   - Implemented full-width, split-screen layout
   - Added modern glass-morphism effects and animations
   - Improved responsive behavior for all screen sizes

2. **Technical Refactoring**:

   - Updated auth layout to remove restrictive container
   - Optimized form components for better reusability
   - Added proper motion transitions between form states
   - Improved form validation and feedback

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created detailed AUTH_PAGE_REDESIGN.md in docs/ui-changes
   - Updated this changelog to record the implementation

### Files Changed

- `frontend/app/auth/layout.tsx` - Modified to allow full-width layout
- `frontend/app/auth/page.tsx` - Completely redesigned with unified form interface
- `frontend/components/auth/login-form.tsx` - Adapted for new layout
- `frontend/components/auth/register-form-new.tsx` - Integrated with tab switching

### Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now switch between login and registration without page transitions
- **Modern Design**: More professional look and feel with current design trends
- **Better Accessibility**: Improved focus management and keyboard navigation
- **Reduced Friction**: Fewer steps required to complete authentication
- **Consistent Branding**: Unified design language across authentication flows

## üõéÔ∏è Notification Preferences API Implementation

**Time**: June 3, 2025
**Type**: Backend Feature Implementation & Testing
**Priority**: Major

### Completed

- Created `user_settings` table and `UserSettings` entity for notification preferences

- Added integration test (`notification-preferences.integration.test.js`)
- Documented test execution policy (run integration tests only when dev server is stopped)
- Updated API and backend progress documentation

### Notes

- All endpoints require authentication
- Preferences are merged with sensible defaults
- See `docs/implementation-reports/API.md` and `docs/project-management/TESTING.md` for details

## Notification Snoozing & Pagination (Backend)

- Added `snoozed_until` column to notifications table (migration: 1750001000000-AddSnoozedUntilToNotifications.ts)

- Added DTOs: SnoozeNotificationDto, BulkSnoozeDto
- Service methods: snooze, bulkSnooze
- WebSocket events for snoozing
- Added paginated notification fetch: GET /notifications/paginated (limit, offset, includeSnoozed)

# CHANGE LOG ‚Äì 2025-06-03

## [Frontend/Admin] Security Dashboard & Auth Integration

- Finalized Zustand auth store: sessionId, deviceFingerprint, idleTimeout, sessionExpiry, lastActivity, and all session actions.
- Device fingerprinting validated in login/register flows; backend analytics confirmed.
- Session activity tracking and timeout warnings tested (useActivityTracker, SessionTimeoutWarning).
- Admin session management UI (SessionManager) fully functional and integrated with backend endpoints.
- Live analytics, security alerts, and session management components are responsive and optimized for mobile.
- All features tested in browser and via automated scripts (`security-dashboard-test.sh`).
- Documentation and changelogs updated for all new features and fixes.

## Registration Form Layout & Design Fixes

- Fixed registration form width/layout issue: registration form now displays at full width (max-w-7xl) as intended.
- Updated `frontend/app/auth/layout.tsx` to conditionally remove the restrictive Card/max-w-md wrapper for `/auth/register` route, allowing the registration form to control its own width and layout.
- Added `data-testid` attributes to registration form containers for robust Playwright UI/design testing.
- Playwright design test (`tests/frontend/register-form-design.spec.ts`) now passes, confirming correct wide layout and grid structure.
- All changes verified with automated Playwright test and screenshot.

## Notification Preferences & Bulk Actions (Frontend & Backend)

- Frontend: Added `/settings/notifications` page for user notification preferences (in-app, email, push)
- Backend: API endpoints `/users/me/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT) fully integrated
- Linked from notifications page settings button
- Frontend: Bulk select, mark as read, and delete in `/notifications` page (checkboxes, select all, action buttons)
- Zustand store and hook updated for bulkMarkAsRead and bulkDelete
- Backend: Added `PATCH /notifications/bulk/mark-read` and `DELETE /notifications/bulk/delete` endpoints
- WebSocket events for bulk actions

**Status**: All features tested and working in dev

## Impact

- Complete, production-grade authentication and session management for admin and users.
- Real-time analytics and security monitoring for admin panel.
- Improved security, auditability, and user experience.

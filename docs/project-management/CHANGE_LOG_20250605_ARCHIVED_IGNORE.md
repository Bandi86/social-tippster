# Archived Folders Ignore Configuration - June 5, 2025

## Changes Made

### Summary

Configured the project to completely ignore all `archived` folders and their contents across all tools and configurations.

### Files Modified

#### 1. Root Configuration Files

**`.gitignore`**

- Added patterns to ignore archived folders from Git tracking
- Patterns: `**/archived/`, `**/archived/**`, `archived/`

**`tsconfig.json`**

- Added archived folders to exclude array
- Prevents TypeScript compilation of archived files
- Patterns: `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`

**`eslint.config.js`**

- Added archived folders to ignores array
- Prevents ESLint from checking archived files
- Patterns: `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`

**`jest.config.ts`**

- Added archived folders to testPathIgnorePatterns
- Prevents Jest from running tests in archived folders
- Patterns: `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`

**`playwright.config.ts`**

- Added testIgnore configuration
- Prevents Playwright from running E2E tests in archived folders
- Patterns: `**/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`

**`.prettierignore`**

- Added archived folders to prevent formatting
- Patterns: `**/archived`, `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`, `docs/archived/**`, `tests/archived/**`

#### 2. Frontend Configuration

**`frontend/tsconfig.json`**

- Added archived folders to exclude array
- Patterns: `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`

**`frontend/next.config.ts`**

- Added webpack configuration to ignore archived folders during builds and development
- Added Turbo rules to exclude archived folders
- Watch options exclude archived folders

**`frontend/.prettierignore`**

- Added archived patterns
- Patterns: `**/archived`, `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`

#### 3. Backend Configuration

**`backend/tsconfig.json`**

- Added archived folders to exclude array
- Patterns: `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`

**`backend/.prettierignore`**

- Added archived patterns
- Patterns: `**/archived`, `**/archived/**`, `archived/**`

#### 4. VS Code Configuration

**`.vscode/settings.json`**

- Added files.exclude for archived folders (hides from file explorer)
- Added search.exclude for archived folders (excludes from search)
- Added files.watcherExclude for archived folders (prevents file watching)
- Comprehensive patterns for all archived locations

### Tools Affected

1. **Git** - No tracking of archived files
2. **TypeScript** - No compilation of archived files
3. **ESLint** - No linting of archived files
4. **Jest** - No unit testing in archived folders
5. **Playwright** - No E2E testing in archived folders
6. **Prettier** - No formatting of archived files
7. **Next.js** - No building/watching of archived files
8. **VS Code** - No file explorer display, search, or file watching

### Result

The `archived` folders are now completely ignored by:

- Version control (Git)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- Code linting (ESLint)
- Code formatting (Prettier)
- Unit testing (Jest)
- E2E testing (Playwright)
- Build processes (Next.js, Webpack)
- IDE features (VS Code file explorer, search, watching)

All archived content is effectively invisible to the development workflow while remaining physically present in the file system.

### Usage

Any folder named `archived` anywhere in the project structure will be ignored by all development tools. This includes:

- `docs/archived/`
- `tests/archived/`
- `frontend/archived/`
- `backend/archived/`
- Any nested `*/archived/` folders

### Verification

To verify the configuration is working:

1. Check that archived folders don't appear in VS Code file explorer
2. Search for content - archived files won't appear in results
3. Run ESLint/Prettier - no archived files will be processed
4. Run tests - no archived tests will execute
5. Build the project - archived files won't affect the build

## Configuration Verification (June 5, 2025)

✅ **All configurations successfully tested and working:**

### Test Results

- **Jest**: No archived tests discovered ✓
- **Playwright**: No archived E2E tests discovered ✓
- **TypeScript**: No archived files compiled ✓
- **Prettier**: Archived files ignored during formatting ✓
- **ESLint**: Archived files excluded from linting ✓

### Performance Impact

- **Faster builds**: Excluded folders reduce compilation time
- **Cleaner test runs**: Only active tests execute
- **Reduced noise**: Development tools focus on current implementation
- **Better developer experience**: VS Code interface remains clean

### Next Steps

- Monitor configuration effectiveness during development
- Update patterns if new archived locations are created
- Document any exceptions or special cases

This will start:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- API Documentation: http://localhost:3001/api/docs

### Alternative Commands

```bash
npm run frontend  # Frontend only (not recommended)
npm run backend   # Backend only (not recommended)
```

# Social Tippster (Backend) – Tipps Module & Image Upload Refactor (2025-06-04)

> **2025-06-04:**
>
> - All tip-related logic is now handled by the dedicated tipps module (`backend/src/modules/tipps/`).
> - The posts module only handles generic post logic; all tip creation, validation, and business rules are in the tipps module.
> - Image upload (storage/validation) and image analysis (OCR, tip extraction) are now handled by separate backend modules.
> - `backend/src/modules/uploads/image-processing.service.ts` is deprecated; all advanced logic is in `backend/src/modules/image-analysis/image-processing.service.ts`.
> - See `docs/implementation-reports/TIPPS_MODULE_REFACTORING.md` for details on the tipps module refactoring.
> - See `docs/implementation-reports/BACKEND_PROGRESS.md` for details on other backend changes.

## Tipps Module Overview

- All tip endpoints are now under `/tipps` (see API docs for details).
- The tipps module is self-contained, type-safe, and production-ready.
- Posts module is now focused only on generic post logic.

## Image Upload & Analysis Refactor

- Uploads module handles file storage and validation only.
- All advanced image analysis is handled by the image-analysis module.

## Testing

- All tipps module endpoints are tested via `tests/backend/test-tipps-module.js` and `tests/backend/tip-validation.service.spec.ts`.
- Backend server must be started manually with `npm run dev` before running any backend or integration tests.

## Documentation

- See `/docs/implementation-reports/TIPPS_MODULE_REFACTORING.md` for technical details.
- See `/docs/implementation-reports/API.md` for endpoint documentation.
- See `/docs/project-management/TESTING.md` for test instructions and policy.

**Project organized and maintained according to professional development standards** ✅

### File Organization

- **Clean Structure:** All test files in `/tests`, documentation in `/docs`
- **Archived Content:** `archived/` folders are completely ignored by all development tools
- **No Root Clutter:** Test, image, and debug files organized in designated folders
- **Subproject Cleanliness:** Frontend and backend maintain clean directory structures

**In summary:**
Your authentication, user management, posts, comments, and admin panel (both backend and frontend) are fully implemented and production-ready. Several admin enhancements (bulk actions, analytics, moderation, audit logs, real-time updates) are started or planned but not yet complete. The project is well-structured, documented, and ready for further enhancements or production deployment.
